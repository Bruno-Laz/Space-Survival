Bruno,

You've done a nice job getting a basic game up and running. I like that you took the time to make the player change colors as it goes. 

If you wanted to push this to the next level, you might make some use of your variables that let you change the speed of the lasers. You could also consider showing the user their longest time alive instead somewhere on the score -- since it just resets when it gets to 0 it's not obvious at first how the game works.

I'd also suggest adding some instructions :)
